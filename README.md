# Early Disease Detection and Risk Prediction for Rural Healthcare in Africa
# Author: Olivier Dusabamahoro

Hello! I’m Olivier Dusabamahoro, and I’m passionate about leveraging data science and machine learning to improve healthcare accessibility and patient outcomes. This project focuses on identifying individuals at risk for prevalent diseases in rural African communities, with the ultimate goal of guiding timely intervention and better resource allocation.


This repository provides a data science solution aimed at early detection and risk prediction of common diseases affecting rural African communities. The primary objective is to leverage machine learning techniques to identify individuals at high risk for diseases such as malaria, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions, thereby enabling proactive healthcare interventions in low-resource settings.

Project Overview
In many rural parts of Africa, limited healthcare infrastructure and late presentation of diseases contribute to high morbidity and mortality rates. Early identification of individuals at risk can help guide timely referrals, targeted healthcare interventions, and better resource allocation. This project aims to build a pipeline that:

Ingests and Preprocesses Healthcare Data:
Cleans and transforms demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and historical health information into a structured dataset ready for modeling.

Develops a Predictive Model:
Uses machine learning algorithms to predict disease risk from patient-level features.

Provides Explainability and Insights:
Offers interpretable results using techniques like SHAP to highlight key factors influencing model predictions.

Delivers an Accessible Frontend Application:
Deploys a user-friendly web application to make risk predictions available to healthcare workers and potentially patients, even in low-bandwidth or resource-constrained environments.

By integrating data preprocessing, modeling, explainability, and a streamlined interface, this solution can support early disease detection, inform patient triage decisions, and ultimately improve health outcomes in underserved communities.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Cleans and standardizes patient data.
Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables.
Scales and normalizes numeric features for optimal model performance.
Predictive Modeling:

Baseline model: Logistic Regression.
Advanced models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost/LightGBM), or Neural Networks (if dataset size permits).
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. Emphasis on recall to minimize false negatives in disease detection.
Explainability:

Leverages SHAP or LIME to produce interpretable visualizations of feature importance.
Offers insights into which factors (age, blood pressure, family history, etc.) drive the model’s prediction.
Deployment:

Backend: A FastAPI or Flask service to host the trained model and provide an API endpoint for predictions.
Frontend: A Streamlit-based user interface to allow healthcare workers to input patient data and view predictions and recommendations.
Hosting: Instructions to deploy on platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.9+ recommended.
Anaconda / Miniconda for environment management.
Git for version control.
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Olivier2201/early_disease_detection.git
cd early_disease_detection
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
conda create -n disease_env python=3.9 -y
conda activate disease_env
Install Dependencies:

Backend requirements:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
Frontend (Streamlit) requirements:
bash
Copy code
cd app/frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../..
Jupyter, EDA, and plotting libraries (if needed):
bash
Copy code
conda install jupyter matplotlib seaborn -y
Data Preparation
Place your health_data.csv file into data/raw/.
Run data preprocessing:
bash
Copy code
python -m src.data_preprocessing
This script cleans the data and saves processed files in data/processed/.
Model Training
Train and evaluate the model:

bash
Copy code
python -m src.train_model
This will produce metrics and save the best model in model/best_model.pkl.

Running the Application
Run the Backend (FastAPI):

bash
Copy code
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

Run the Frontend (Streamlit):

bash
Copy code
cd app/frontend
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

Testing
Run tests:

bash
Copy code
pytest tests/
Usage
Open the Streamlit UI.
Input patient details such as age, blood pressure, and family history.
Click "Predict" to get a risk score and recommendation.
Healthcare workers can use these predictions to prioritize clinic visits or further diagnostic tests.
Roadmap & Future Enhancements
Data Integration: Incorporate larger and more diverse datasets for robust model generalization.
Additional Diseases: Extend the prediction capabilities to other prevalent diseases in the region.
Model Explainability in UI: Integrate SHAP visualizations directly into the frontend for better trust and transparency.
Offline Capabilities: Develop a lightweight offline version of the tool for clinics with intermittent internet access.
Continuous Monitoring & Updating: Integrate feedback loops to retrain and improve the model as new data become available.
